# cifar100
a simple cnn image-classification modules self-implemented tested on database cifar100 based on pytorch 


## simple cnn model
all the code of cnn classification in dir cnn_model  
**first** you have to download the cifar100 data(link can easy be found in net), download the data in the your local path.  
 example: you put the data in path: **D:/CifarPicture_Classication/data/** 
 
**then** can easy run the project by the shell command
```shell
python train.py --dir_path D:/CifarPicture_Classication/data/
```
